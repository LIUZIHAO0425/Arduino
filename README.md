# Arduino
Tactile display control using GUI (WPF) and the serial communication of Arduino

## 74HC595 + Arduino 
Mainly apply Arduino's serial communication and use 74HC595 for I/O port expansion
We need 8 74HC595s to provide 64 outputs

## GUI (WPF)
Use visual studio and download and install the WPF plugin.
Use XAML and C# to create GUI (graphical user interface) and control Arduino directly through the interface.
